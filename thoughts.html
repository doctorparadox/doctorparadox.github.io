<p>Looks like I'm not the only one Going Back to Basics -- GTD guru <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a>
  has an experiment on collected <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom">wisdom</a> here on GitHub,
  and Dave Winer is using GitHub for various projects relating to his blog <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News">Scripting News</a>
  including a backup process he calls "<a href="http://this.how/scriptingNews/nightlyArchive.opml">two-factor archiving</a>."</p>

  <p>There are also numerous projects relating to <a href="https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/2021-01-11-simple-github-website/index.html">blogging on GitHub</a>
    out there, from the default Jekyll/GitHub Pages integration to using SSGs with GitHub Actions, as well as more
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26068032">custom and DIY methods of rendering Markdown</a> or plain text into a lightweight blog engine. I'm enjoying exploring
    this ecosystem at the moment, as an effort in reclaiming blogging's roots in owning your output in a "full stack"
    manner versus being locked in by one or more platforms without a lot of (or any) data portability. It feels like
    an important counterculture movement at the moment -- and I plan to "just keep swimming" in it!</p>

<p>So much change rippling through my network -- so many career changers, so many
looking for something  more fulfilling, so many people clawing our way back to
a sense of purpose, deep meaning, and core values. We want to get back to basics,
back to our foundations, and to figure out so somehow go "back" with forward
momentum. Because the only way out is through.</p>

<p>For me, part of that journey is about getting back to blogging. That's my Original Face --
my origin story. Blogging is the kind of Learning Out Loud that lit me up, drew
me in, and ignited a fire that still burns. We wanted to create a brave new world of information --
but despite our best intentions, it seems to have turned into a world of disinformation.</p>

<p>As yak shaving tends to go, I'm hobbling along with a DIY situation here until I can
finish up a research loop into Static Site Generators vs. Headless CMS options. I
already have a <a href="http://www.doctorparadox.net">WordPress blog</a> and I'm looking for
something both more lightweight and closer to the command line so I can do some
reskilling and upskilling in the technical acumen front at the same time. If you
have any feelings or suggestions, hit me up <a href="http://www.twitter.com/doctorparadox/">on Twitter</a>!</p>
