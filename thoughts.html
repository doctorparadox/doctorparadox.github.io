<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed. It's easy to get distracted from our Purpose -- there are so many shiny objects. Take heart! We all struggle
  with it. You are not alone.

<p>I've become deeply obsessed with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, the most dreamy note-taking meets
  knowledge base forever storage app I've ever had the pleasure to encounter (and as a longtime compulsive note-taker
  and Evernote information hoarder/digital packrat, I do <strong>not</strong> say that lightly!). As a companion to
  this I've fallen in love with the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal
    Knowledge Management (PKM)</a> and <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Second Brain</a> movements, which
  feel like a breath of fresh air in this brave new world of being constantly pelted and overwhelmed by the
  onslaught of information and <a href="https://doctorparadox.net/dictionaries/disinformation-dictionary/">disinformation</a>.</p>

<p>It feels like a universe where tools and philosophies around code and content are converging -- down to the fact
  that my Obsidian UI and my <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> UI appear remarkably the same. Both applications offer almost endless customization
  functionality and extensive libraries of packages and plugins (here's a GitHub List of my favorite
  <a href="https://github.com/stars/doctorparadox/lists/obsidian-plugins">Obsidian plugins</a> so far). For people who crave the ability to get under the hood
  and truly, fully own their data and their workflow experience, it's just a tall glass of water.</p>

  <p>This PKM ecosystem is reminding me of the early days of the web, for those of us who were drawn in by the idea
    of democratizing information and making technological creativity accessible to as many people as possible. Much like it feels
    elsewhere in culture and politics, it turns out not everyone agrees with this mission and fundamental philosophy of openness. I
    didn't really expect that outcome -- perhaps I was na√Øve. That makes this "new to me" (re)discovery of communities of
    praxis around self-determination in the digital sphere a powerful return to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_face">Original Face</a>.</p>

<p>Here's to the digital dreamers!</p>

<em>[<strong>CAVEAT:</strong> There's also a danger in getting too attached to the PKM ideology itself. There's a
  <a href="https://doctorparadox.net/diptychs/goldilocks-zone-vs-unbounded-growth/">Goldilocks Zone</a> that some <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUMFE66dxeweppDvgbNAb5hukXzXQu8ErVNv">self-described
     note-taking gurus may have wandered out of</a>...]</em>

<p>Looks like I'm not the only one Going Back to Basics -- GTD guru <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a>
  has an experiment on collected <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom">wisdom</a> here on GitHub,
  and Dave Winer is using GitHub for various projects relating to his blog <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News">Scripting News</a>
  including a backup process he calls "<a href="http://this.how/scriptingNews/nightlyArchive.opml">two-factor archiving</a>."</p>

  <p>There are also numerous projects relating to <a href="https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/2021-01-11-simple-github-website/index.html">blogging on GitHub</a>
    out there, from the default Jekyll/GitHub Pages integration to using SSGs with GitHub Actions, as well as more
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26068032">custom and DIY methods of rendering Markdown</a> or plain text into a lightweight blog engine. I'm enjoying exploring
    this ecosystem at the moment, as an effort in reclaiming blogging's roots in owning your output in a "full stack"
    manner versus being locked in by one or more platforms without a lot of (or any) data portability. It feels like
    an important counterculture movement at the moment -- and I plan to "just keep swimming" in it!</p>

<p>So much change rippling through my network -- so many career changers, so many
looking for something  more fulfilling, so many people clawing our way back to
a sense of purpose, deep meaning, and core values. We want to get back to basics,
back to our foundations, and to figure out so somehow go "back" with forward
momentum. Because the only way out is through.</p>

<p>For me, part of that journey is about getting back to blogging. That's my Original Face --
my origin story. Blogging is the kind of Learning Out Loud that lit me up, drew
me in, and ignited a fire that still burns. We wanted to create a brave new world of information --
but despite our best intentions, it seems to have turned into a world of disinformation.</p>

<p>As yak shaving tends to go, I'm hobbling along with a DIY situation here until I can
finish up a research loop into Static Site Generators vs. Headless CMS options. I
already have a <a href="http://www.doctorparadox.net">WordPress blog</a> and I'm looking for
something both more lightweight and closer to the command line so I can do some
reskilling and upskilling in the technical acumen front at the same time. If you
have any feelings or suggestions, hit me up <a href="http://www.twitter.com/doctorparadox/">on Twitter</a>!</p>
