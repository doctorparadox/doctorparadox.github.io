<a href="index.html">&laquo; Back to the front</a><br /><br />

<h2>10/4/22</h2>

So much change rippling through my network -- so many career changers, so many
looking for something  more fulfilling, so many people clawing our way back to
a sense of purpose, deep meaning, and core values. We want to get back to basics,
back to our foundations, and to figure out so somehow go "back" with forward
momentum. Because the only way out is through.<br /><br />

For me, part of that journey is about getting back to blogging. That's my Original Face --
my origin story. Blogging is the kind of Learning Out Loud that lit me up, drew
me in, and ignited a fire that still burns. We wanted to create a brave new world of information --
but despite our best intentions, it seems to have turned into a world of disinformation.<br /><br />

As yak shaving tends to go, I'm hobbling along with a DIY situation here until I can
finish up a research loop into Static Site Generators vs. Headless CMS options. I
already have a <a href="http://www.doctorparadox.net">WordPress blog</a> and I'm looking for
something both more lightweight and closer to the command line so I can do some
reskilling and upskilling in the technical acumen front at the same time. If you
have any feelings or suggestions, hit me up <a href="http://www.twitter.com/doctorparadox/">on Twitter</a>!
