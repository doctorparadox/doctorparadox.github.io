<h2>Learning Out Loud</h2>

Here's to the creators, builders, polymaths, tinkerers,
synthesists and analysts of all stripes.<br /><br />

To those of us who miss the ethos of Web2.0 and even Web1.0.<br /><br />

To those who aimed to democratize technology, only to see it
taken in terrifying other directions.<br /><br />

To those unsure of where to go next.<br /><br />

Remember: Not all who wander are lost.<br /><br />

Here's to finding our way.
